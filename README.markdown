blinkyfun
=========

This is [blinkyfun](https://github.com/jonspeicher/blinkyfun), an interface to
the Blinkinlabs BlinkyTape LED strip (http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytape).

Description
-----------

This is something I threw together during late nights when I wanted something
tangible to play with. It tries to do fun things with the BlinkyTape by
Blinkinlabs. It's pretty rough and likely to be full of bugs. Use at your own
risk.
